  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/health-and-social-care">School of Health and Social Care</a>
 at University of Essex. 
    My research explores the design and use of digital technology for supporting social interaction. 
  Informed by my interdisciplinary training across speech and language therapy, human computer interaction (HCI), augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), multimodality and psychology, I am committed to bringing together different disciplinary perspectives and innovative methods to examine and address complex social problems. 
    
    My projects have focused on:
<ul>
  <li>Digitally-mediated in-person communication that involves non-speaking or minimally verbal children and their social partners</li>
  <li>Personalised learning and literacy technologies for the classroom</li>
  <li>Mental health interventions for children and parents</li>
</ul>

I have a publication record and best paper awards in premier international conferences such as the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) and Interaction Design and Children (IDC). I have published across journals that include Disability and Society, AAC journal and British Journal of Educational Technology. Beyond academia, I regularly work with colleagues from the NHS, charity sector and school settings to generate impactful solutions based on evidence based research.
